# Project 2 (Number Guessing Game)


I have created a number guessing game in python. This guessing game will check user input and display the proper response. 
The game will also output your attempts and display time taken in seconds.

To run the game, you simply click the run button in your preferred IDE or type this code in the console
```powershell
python.exe .\Project_2.py
```
You simply have to guess a number from 1- 99 and the script will notify the user after each guess, 
if it is too low, too high or if you got guessed the number correctly. Example of output

```python
Enter a Number between 1 - 99: 44
Too Low!
Guess again: 47
Too High!
Guess again: 46
Great job! You guessed the number in 3 tries and in 5 seconds
```
